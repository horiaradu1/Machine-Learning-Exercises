    "### A Note on Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "Most documents only contain a small subset of the vocabulary, resulting in a very sparse data matrix.\n",
    "To handle the sparsity, in this exercise `data` is represented as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`, which can store sparse matrices efficiently while still allowing efficient row-based indexing.\n",
    "You can learn more about `csr_matrix` and other ways of dealing with sparse matrices at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that `data` is **not** a normal NumPy array.\n",
    "While most operations will be the same as with a normal dense array, **you cannot use a sparse matrix to index another matrix**.\n",
    "If you need to do this, either first convert the matrix to a NumPy array with the `toarray()` method, or use methods specifically designed to work with sparse matrices."
